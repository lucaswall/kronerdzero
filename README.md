# Warriors of Kronerd #

A shoot 'em up game for the Raspberry Pi 3.

Warriors of Kronerd is a Raspberry Pi 3 game written using only low level interactions with the hardware, without using any operating system (replacing it). It's a bare metal programming example of a game.

It was written just for fun, as a learning experience and out of nostalgia.

The game is not yet finished.

What is done:

 - Framebuffer init and sprite system.
 - Offscreen plane and fast copy to framebuffer.
 - Sprite animations.
 - Sprite collisions.
 - Mersenne Twister pseudorandom number sequence generated.
 - Hardware random number access for MT seed initialization.
 - Access to 1Ghz system timer.
 - Basic bitmap font to blit text and numbers.
 - Scene support.

What to code next:

 - Controller support (probably original NES hooked to GPIO).
 - Sound and music support (on a separate CPY core?).
 - DMA offscreen plane copy to framebuffer?
 - Use another CPU core to copy to framebuffer?


## How to run

Check the Makefile.

You will need an ARM compiler installed on your system. Running a `make build` should generate the `kernel7.img` file. This file, along with the `config.txt` should be placed on the first FAT32 partition of your Raspberry Pi 3 booting SD card.

Once powered the game should start immediately.
